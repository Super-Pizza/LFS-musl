The Gettext-tiny package contains utilities for internationalization and localization. These allow programs to be compiled with NLS (Native Language Support), enabling them to output messages in the user's native language.

## 7.7.1. Installation of Gettext-tiny

For our temporary set of tools, we only need to install three programs from Gettext-tiny.

Compile the package:

```shell
make LIBINTL=MUSL prefix=/usr
```

Install the **msgfmt**, **msgmerge**, and **xgettext** programs:

```shell
cp -v {msgfmt,msgmerge,xgettext} /usr/bin
```
