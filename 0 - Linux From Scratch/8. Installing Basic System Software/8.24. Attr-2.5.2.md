The Attr package contains utilities to administer the extended attributes of filesystem objects.

---
## 8.24.1. Installation of Attr

Add a missing include:

```shell
sed -Ee "1s|(.*)|#include <libgen.h>\n\1|;" -i tools/attr.c
```

Prepare Attr for compilation:

```shell
./configure --prefix=/usr \
 --disable-static \
 --sysconfdir=/etc \
 --docdir=/usr/share/doc/attr-2.5.2
```

Compile the package:

```shell
make
```

The tests must be run on a filesystem that supports extended attributes such as the ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems. To test the results, issue:

```shell
make -k check
```

One test will fail, because of a minor inconsistency. The following command should return the failure:

```shell
grep -A1 '\[13\] \$' test-suite.log
```

Expected:

```shell
[13] $ setfattr -n user -v value f -- failed
setfattr: f: Not supported            != setfattr: f: Operation not supported
```

Install the package:

```shell
make install
```
