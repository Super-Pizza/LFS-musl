The GDBM package contains the GNU Database Manager. It is a library of database functions that uses extensible hashing and works like the standard UNIX dbm. The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs, searching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key along with its data.

## 8.38.1. Installation of GDBM

Add a missing include:

```shell
sed -Ee "/#/s|(.*)|#include <sys/types.h>\n\1|;" -i tools/gdbmapp.h
```

Prepare GDBM for compilation:

```shell
./configure --prefix=/usr    \
            --disable-static \
            --enable-libgdbm-compat
```

**The meaning of the configure option:**

`--enable-libgdbm-compat`
This switch enables building the libgdbm compatibility library. Some packages outside of LFS may require the older DBM routines it provides.

Compile the package:

```shell
make
```

To test the results, issue:

```shell
make check
```

Install the package:

```shell
make install
```
